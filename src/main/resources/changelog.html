    <h1 id="changelist-ho-1.432">Changelist HO! 1.432</h1>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Hattrick Organizer now requires Java 1.6 (aka JRE6). Open JDK supports older operating systems that oracle does not. Please update your Java installation if needed.</p></li>
    <li><p>Player subskills . Training is now minute based. Correct counting only for matches downloaded in 1.431 or later. It is possible to delete your own matches by the db cleanup tool, and download them again by archive options in download. After this a full subskill recalculation could be interesting. . Osmosis training has been added. A small training effect for all players on the field. . Added green background for 100% trainees and yellow for 50% trainees in training prediction (white background for osmosis training). . Use subskill overflow for training prediction to avoid rounding errors hiding coach and assitant number changes effects. . The skill level effect on training has been adjusted. . Skill drops due to age at 30 or above, or at skills of 16 or above is in as a first version. Speeds will require more or less tuning. . Training offset has been removed, and been replaced with an option to adjust the subskill directly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Team Analyzer . All update restrictions have been removed, including favorite teams. . Update will now download the matches to fill out your autofilter request, or the 30 last opponent matches if a manual filter is selected. . Tournament opponents are in, and so are tournament matches. . Auto filter options are now saved when you analyze, and should reappear that way until changed. . Auto filter options for tournament and masters matches. . Fixed bug that renaming team after the last league match prevented analyzing matches before name changes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Match order uploads . The option to upload match orders to Hattrick have been added. . This is a Hattrick supporter feature, and non-supporters will find the upload button inactive. . The lineup tab now has its own tabs, the new ones are: . Lineup - the old one. . Match orders - a place to set and view match orders. . Penalty takers - a place to view and set the penalty shooter list. . Upload/Download - a place to upload and download orders to and from specific matches.</p></li>
    <li><p>Special Events . got a lot of improvments (esp. the filter)</p></li>
    <li><p>Lazy initialization/refresh . The content of each tab is now loaded not before the tab is opened for the first time. Analogous, if the content of a tab needs to be refreshed, it is only refreshed if the tab is currently showing. If it’s not showing, it will be refreshed as soon as it gets shown. This works (at the moment) for all tabs except lineup, players, transfers. Lazy initialization/refresh will noticeable (depending on the number of modules you are using) decrease startup time and reduce the memory footprint of the application.</p></li>

    <h2 id="special-notes-2">Special Notes:</h2>
    <p>HO 1.400 includes a first version to predict the ratings of the new match engine. The quality proved to be quite good at internal tests, but the differences may be a bit higher than for the old engine. Use the prediction offset calculation to get better results and provide feedback in the HO! forum. That way we can enhance the accuracy. Thx!</p>
    <p>The 2 most active HO1 developers from the lasst months are on vacation for the next 2 respectively 3 weeks. Thats not planned, but a funny coincidence. It might get a bit silent from HO! side during this time. We expect to have helpful feedback when we’re back - especially regardings the new rating predictions.</p>
